# v0.17 (2021-09-10)

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Renamed `Component.context` and `Component.template` to `get_context_data` and `get_template_name`. The old methods still work, but emit a deprecation warning.

    This change was done to sync naming with Django's class based views, and make using django-components more familiar to Django users. `Component.context` and `Component.template` will be removed when version 1.0 is released.
