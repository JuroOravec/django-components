# v0.22 (2022-07-26)

#### Feat

- All files inside components subdirectores are autoimported to simplify setup.

    An existing project might start to get `AlreadyRegistered` errors because of this. To solve this, either remove your custom loading of components, or set `"autodiscover": False` in `settings.COMPONENTS`.
