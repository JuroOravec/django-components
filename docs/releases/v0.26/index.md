# v0.26 🚨📢 (2023-03-14)

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Changed the syntax for `{% slot %}` tags. From now on, we separate defining a slot (`{% slot %}`) from filling a slot with content (`{% fill %}`). This means you will likely need to change a lot of slot tags to fill.

    We understand this is annoying, but it's the only way we can get support for nested slots that fill in other slots, which is a very nice feature to have access to. Hoping that this will feel worth it!
