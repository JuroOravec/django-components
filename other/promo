How to make use of the fact that somebody wants to fund django-components?

- Frame it as that we're raising funds to pay for the development of django-components
  for 1 year, and that company X has already funded us with Y months of development.

- Look for podcasts / forums / content creators focusing on Django, Python, and web development in general.

  - Reach out for a talk / interview / guest post / etc - describing the project, django-components,
    and the Python "AI compiler".

- Reach out to the 3-4 companies/people that I know use or are interested in django-components,
  and who are more than just "users" of the library.

  - The smart guy
  - The guy who asked about perf
  - Panco
  - BezRealitky
  - Reach out on Reddit, HackerNews, Django forum, Python forum.

- Prepare one-pager, outlining what would be the benefits of funding the development of django-components:

  - Include the goals from NGI application
  - Consulting services (10 hours per month?)
  - Supporting the project SLA (e.g. bug fixes, new features, etc.)
  - LLM prompt for writing Django components
  - Component library for Django
  - Show the company's logo on the website + mention in all talks / interviews / social media posts / etc.

- Maybe try to format the above as packages? (e.g. as known from Patreon or Donio) E.g.:

  - $10 to get the LLM prompt for writing Django components
  - $20 to get early access to the component library for Django
  - $100 to get the consulting services (10 hours per month?)
  - $500 to get the company's logo on the website + mention in all talks / interviews / social media posts / etc.
  - $1000 to get SLA - we will fix their bugs within 1 week, and implement new features within 1 (?) month.

- Create a video series / podcast series / blog series / etc - describing the project, django-components,
  and the Python "AI compiler".
