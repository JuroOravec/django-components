# LATER (DOCS)
#   - Document `component_id`?
#     - Add tests for this


# LATER (JS / CSS)
# TODO - Document: How do we handle when a JS is included using Media.js????
#        -> We leave it as is. We do NOT wrap it in the self-invoking fn
# TODO - Doument how we allow to inline the cached JS / CSS, so there doesn't have to be 100s requests?

Django-components is a package that introduces component-based architecture to Django's server-side rendering. It aims to combine Django's templating system with the modularity seen in modern frontend frameworks.

<!-- # TODO - this looks like AI generated - rework it, making it more specific, e.g. -->
- Rich templating syntax on par with Vue / React
- Combine the 1. and 2. into single point
- Fully tested at 97% coverage
- TAGLINE: _"The last component library for Django you will ever need"_ - Superset of other similar libraries like (list them out...)
- Supports both Vue-like and Django-like behavior
- Creazy fast, because it uses selectolax -> NO LONGER TRUE :(
## Features

1. üß© **Reusability:** Allows creation of self-contained, reusable UI elements.
2. üì¶ **Encapsulation:** Each component can include its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. üöÄ **Server-side rendering:** Components render on the server, improving initial load times and SEO.
4. üêç **Django integration:** Works within the Django ecosystem, using familiar concepts like template tags.
5. ‚ö° **Asynchronous loading:** Components can render independently opening up for integration with JS frameworks like HTMX or AlpineJS.

Potential benefits:

- üîÑ Reduced code duplication
- üõ†Ô∏è Improved maintainability through modular design
- üß† Easier management of complex UIs
- ü§ù Enhanced collaboration between frontend and backend developers

Django-components can be particularly useful for larger Django projects that require a more structured approach to UI development, without necessitating a shift to a separate frontend framework.

<!-- # TODO - In docs, for defining Component templates, show all alternative ways:
    template_name, get_template_name(), template or get_template()   -->

## Quickstart

django-components lets you create reusable blocks of code needed to generate the front end code you need for a modern app. 

Define a component in `components/calendar/calendar.py` like this:
```python
@register("calendar")
class Calendar(Component):
    template_name = "template.html"

    def get_context_data(self, date):
        return {"date": date}
```

With this `template.html` file:

```htmldjango
<div class="calendar-component">Today's date is <span>{{ date }}</span></div>
```

Use the component like this:

```htmldjango
{% component "calendar" date="2024-11-06" %}{% endcomponent %}
```

And this is what gets rendered:

```html
<div class="calendar-component">Today's date is <span>2024-11-06</span></div>
```
