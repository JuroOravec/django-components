Great! Before we start, what topic would you like to be interviewed on? Also, do you prefer a friendly, curious, or challenging interview style?

You said:
So, the topic I want to discuss, I think it could be summarized as Vue in Python and Vue in Rust.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! You want to discuss using Vue with Python and Rust. How would you like the interview style—friendly, curious, or challenging?

You said:
Could we start with a friendly one and then move on to the challenging so that we address both the high-level overview but also some nitty-gritty details?
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a great approach! We'll start with a friendly overview and then dive into more challenging technical details.

Let's begin!

To start, could you give a high-level explanation of how Vue integrates with Python and Rust?

You said:
Yeah, so over the last six to nine months, I was working on this project, Django Components, which basically brings component-based front-end UI to Django. But I kept working on this, and the scope kept growing, and what started as frustration out of you know, missing the basic tools for front-ends in Python and Django, now has grown into basically a roadmap how to basically achieve to be able to write, view, and use it in Django or Python.
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a fascinating journey! So, what started as a frustration with Django’s front-end tooling led you to build Django Components, and now it's grown into a full roadmap for integrating Vue with Django and Python.

Can you walk me through how Django Components works? Specifically, how does it allow developers to write and use Vue seamlessly in a Django environment?

You said:
Yes, that's a great question. Okay, so the point is that Django Components is written similarly to Vue. So, you know, in Vue, you have those three sections, the template, which is usually HTML, the CSS, and the JavaScript. Now, Django Components also has a similar concept of, well, components, and these have four sections to them. The first three are the same, so that's the HTML, the backbone, the JavaScript, the logic, and CSS, the styling. But since it's implemented in Python, then there's also, you know, the fourth component, or the fourth part to it, and that's the Python code itself, which glues it all together. Now, the second important part is that there's a huge advantage to the fact that Vue has its own file extension and file format, right, the Vue files. This is important because it allows you to basically treat the file as, you know, having three sections, and each section basically being text, right, and, like, text which can be pre-processed and which is, what's the word, which needs text which needs to be parsed, right, that basically the idea is that when you have a Vue HTML template, then Vue parses that HTML, right, so there's, like, this middle layer. It's not directly passed on as the HTML, and that means that the same can be done for Django Components, where when we have the individual sections, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, then we can pre-process those sections as necessary, and that means that we can have same
ChatGPT said:
That makes a lot of sense! So, Django Components borrows the structure of Vue by splitting components into sections—HTML, JavaScript, and CSS—but adds Python as a fourth section to tie everything together. That extra layer allows for deeper integration with Django’s backend.

I really like your point about Vue files being parsed before being rendered. It sounds like Django Components follows a similar approach, where the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sections are pre-processed before being used. Could you elaborate on how that parsing process works in Django Components? Do you use a specific preprocessor, or is it handled within Django itself?

You said:
Yeah, so we use our own pre-processor, so I wrote basically, so it's like a Rust-based pre-processor which modifies the HTML templates so that
ChatGPT said:
Oh, that's really interesting! So, you're using a Rust-based pre-processor to modify the HTML templates before Django renders them. Could you explain why you chose Rust for this part? Was it for performance reasons, or was there another key advantage?

You said:
Yeah, performance. Initially, I made it in Python, but that was just extremely slow, as in we are talking about half a minute to render a single page.
ChatGPT said:
Wow, half a minute per page is definitely not practical! So, switching to Rust must have made a huge difference. How much faster did it get after moving from Python to Rust?

You said:
uh, about like 40 times faster, I think.
ChatGPT said:
That's a massive improvement! Going from thirty seconds to under a second is a game-changer. What were the biggest challenges you faced while rewriting the pre-processor in Rust?

You said:
Yeah, sorry, I meant that writing the Rust parser was sort of the easy part, because there is already an existing XML parser package in Rust, which I was able to use to write the preprocessor. So that was the easy part, right?
ChatGPT said:
Got it! So leveraging an existing XML parser in Rust made the actual parsing straightforward. What, then, was the hardest part of the transition? Was it integrating the Rust preprocessor with Django, or were there other unexpected challenges?

You said:
So, actually, I would say that, like, these Rust bindings are, again, like, the easy part, because they, right now, we use them only for, basically, string manipulation. So, for big tasks, like, you know, like, preprocessing the HTML, or parsing the Django template to enable, um,
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense—since the Rust bindings are mainly handling string manipulation, they’re relatively simple to integrate. You were about to say something about parsing Django templates. Were there specific challenges in making Django’s templating system work smoothly with your Rust preprocessor?

You said:
So, maybe a bit of a correction, so not necessarily with the Rust preprocessor, but let me take a step back. So, because I am building all of this off of Django templates, right, the project that I'm working on, that I'm maintaining, is written in Django and Django templates, and so that's the responsibility I handle, right, so things have to, right now, things have to work with Django and Django templates. So, basically, I am also, as I'm working towards sort of being able to write Vue files in Python, the middle step towards there is to, and let me now think, is to enable or to modernize and to empower the Django templates, because it feels like the last time the templating in Django received some love and attention was maybe six to ten years, so it is already outdated, and when you compare it to modern frameworks like React and Vue, then there is a lot of missing features and a lot of, you know, things to wish for, and so that's kind of the core of what I'm working on, so, you know, it is basically bringing Vue features into Django templates, and, you know, and this is actually the kind of the
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! So your work isn't just about integrating Vue with Django—it's also about modernizing Django’s templating system itself. Since Django templates haven’t evolved much in recent years, you're essentially bringing in concepts from Vue to make them more powerful and feature-rich.

That’s a pretty big undertaking! What specific Vue features are you working on adding to Django templates? Are you focusing on things like reactivity, component-based structure, or something else?

You said:
Yeah, thanks, you're right. So, as a note, reactivity, or let's leave reactivity for next question, because that's a topic in and of itself. But yes, so, bringing UI development. As I mentioned, also the possibility to write both HTML, CSS, and JavaScript per components. Next is being able to pass props, so, you know, some sort of inputs to components. Then also some nitty-gritty, like being able to validate those inputs. We also have slots, so, view-like slots, where one can pass, like, slot data, or like, you know, so-called scoped slots, as we know it from Vue. So, that works for Django components as well, with the difference that you pass not JavaScript data, but Python data. But we are working also towards supporting passing JavaScript data through. Yeah, so, as I said, you also have scoped slots. It's also possible to, similar to Vue, to define slots either as a as a, you know, as a component, or kind of content, or as a function. We also, there's also support for Vue-like provide and inject.
ChatGPT said:
That’s really impressive! You’re essentially bringing core Vue concepts—like props, scoped slots, and even provide/inject—to Django templates, but with Python instead of JavaScript. The fact that you're also working on passing JavaScript data through shows how deeply you're thinking about bridging the two ecosystems.

Now, you mentioned reactivity being its own topic. Let’s dive into that—how are you handling reactivity in Django templates? Are you aiming for something like Vue’s reactive state management, or is it a different approach?

You said:
Yes, so, in a nutshell, we delegate Vue's reactivity to AlpineJS, because AlpineJS, behind the scenes, it is built on top of Vue's reactivity, but without Vue's management of the HTML. So, as for how far this can be taken, I have written a still proof of concept, but I am well underway to port VueTify, the UI component library, onto Django components.
ChatGPT said:
That’s a really smart approach—using AlpineJS to leverage Vue’s reactivity while keeping control over the HTML rendering in Django. It seems like a lightweight way to get Vue-like interactivity without needing the full Vue runtime.

And porting Vuetify to Django Components? That’s huge! What are the biggest challenges in making a Vue-based UI library work within Django’s templating system?

You said:
Yes, so there, the biggest challenge was, you know, building up the view interface for AlpineJS, because, you know, so AlpineJS, it sort of already has all the necessary features. It supports, so to speak, components, like AlpineJS components, and it has support for view reactivity. So that means that you can also write things like composables with AlpineJS. However, AlpineJS doesn't, you know, in modern view, you use the reactivity features as ref, watch, watch effect, and, you know, compute it, and these sort of functions. When you are using AlpineJS, it practically uses these same tools, so fundamental tools underneath, behind the scenes, but AlpineJS doesn't expose these through its API. It only exposes, only, I think, watch effect, and so, you know, so the thing is that to be able to make AlpineJS work similarly to view,
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! AlpineJS has the necessary reactivity features under the hood, but it doesn’t expose Vue’s full API—like ref, computed, and watch. So, to make AlpineJS work more like Vue, you had to build a layer that provides those missing pieces.

That sounds like a tricky balance. How did you go about bridging that gap? Did you create custom utilities to mimic Vue’s reactivity functions, or did you modify AlpineJS itself?

You said:
Yeah, so I built in custom utility functions. So basically, as I said, AlpineJS, it exposes the watch effect and maybe one or two more reactivity features or functions. But these two or three functions were enough to rebuild the whole reactivity API. As an example, if I am able to construct a reactivity object and I'm able to use watch effect, which re-triggers the callback whenever the object has changed, then I can rebuild, for example, the watch function by using the callback within a watch effect. Or I can rebuild computed, which again uses the same thing but also updates an associated ref with the result of the callback. So I was able to recreate the fundamentals of the reactivity API of Vue on top of AlpineJS.
ChatGPT said:
That’s really clever! By using AlpineJS’s watchEffect and a reactive object, you essentially reconstructed Vue’s reactivity API—things like watch, computed, and ref. It’s impressive how you managed to rebuild those core features with just a few foundational tools.

Now that you’ve got this Vue-like reactivity working within Django Components, how does it impact performance? Are there any trade-offs compared to using full Vue, or does it stay lightweight thanks to AlpineJS?

You said:
So, this is too far, or too early to be able to say, so, rather, I would just continue describing how the integration works. So, basically, now that there's the Reactivity API on top of AlpineJS, next thing was to rewrite Vuetify to use this Reactivity API, because, you know, so Vuetify is written really well and nicely, and well, you know, well-organized, so most of the logic in Vuetify is actually written independently from the rendering or templating part of the components. And so, for individual components in Vuetify, there are functions which define the behavior and the fields or the API of the components that will be available within the components as a template, but, again, this is separate from the template itself. And so, they have defined, so to speak, like renderless components, and these renderless components are written as Reactivity composables, right, so it's like a function which creates some Reactive objects and returns them. So these renderless components were already using a lot of Vue's Reactivity API, like watch, computed, refs, and so on, and so you can see there that the only difference was that initially or originally in Vuetify's implementation, those functions imported Vue Reactivity from Vue, but in my case, I needed to supply, I needed to sort of dependency inject the API for the Reactivity, so I had to modify all the renderless component functions to accept additional input arguments, which was the Reactivity API that was built on top of AlpineJS. And so the cool thing about this was that basically, like, I would say, like 95% of all the code for Vuetify component logic stayed the same, because what I needed to change was only to pass the extra Reactivity API directly through the functions instead of importing it with an import statement, and since I'm using, and, like, there were also other changes, like removing some templating logic, but as I said, like 95% of all the logic could remain the same, and so what I then ended up with was that I was, or, like, then the next step would be to integrate these renderless component functions into AlpineJS, and here comes the fact that AlpineJS has support for these sort of Alpine components, and
ChatGPT said:
That’s a really elegant approach! Instead of rewriting Vuetify from scratch, you modified the renderless components to accept your custom Reactivity API built on AlpineJS. That way, most of the original logic remained unchanged, and you avoided a full rewrite.

It sounds like the final step is integrating these modified renderless components into AlpineJS. How are you handling that part? Are you mapping them directly to Alpine components, or do you need to introduce another layer to bridge the gap?

You said:
Yes, both. So these do get ported as, or they are implemented as Alpine components, but I still had to build one more bridge to be able to make Alpine.js components behave like Vue components. And so I wrote another library that basically allows you to write Alpine.js components, or like the x-data, or like data objects of Alpine.js, and to be able to write those as Vue objects, or Vue components with an object API. And what I mean by this is that when you normally define an Alpine.js component, then you use the x-data, and you specify an object. And that object may have some fields, and each field is then reactive. But when you define a Vue object, or a Vue component, then to be able to use Composition API, you specify the setup method, and there you use the Composition API. And what gets returned from the setup is what will be the API, or the interface of the component, or the fields that will be available to the template.
ChatGPT said:
That makes a lot of sense! So, to make AlpineJS components behave more like Vue components, you built a library that lets you define Alpine components using Vue’s object API. Instead of just using x-data with a static object, you now have a setup-like function that returns the reactive properties, just like Vue’s Composition API.

That’s a really powerful abstraction! How does this affect the developer experience? Does it make transitioning from Vue to Django Components smoother?

You said:
Yes, so my aim, or what I'm hoping for, is that we would make it possible to write Vue files in Python or in Django and so on, and even in other languages, exactly for this reason, right? If you start with a project, you could start writing Vue files, and let's say that after maybe six months, the project is still growing, and you realize that okay, maybe this is already complex enough that we should maybe split off the frontend UI from the Django server. And so the aim, as you can see, is that really to give smooth transition from small to mid-sized projects, which don't need to necessarily maintain frontend independently from the backend, to larger projects where the separation already makes sense.
ChatGPT said:
That’s a really smart goal—allowing developers to start with Vue-style components directly in Django, but with the flexibility to transition to a fully separate frontend later if needed. It solves a big pain point for projects that begin as small full-stack apps but eventually grow into something that benefits from a more traditional frontend-backend split.

How close do you think you are to achieving this vision? Are there any major hurdles left before developers can fully write Vue files in Django with this system?

You said:
Yes, so while this problem is tiered, or, you know, there's a lot of, well, it's iterative, and, you know, so there's a question of, like, when is, what even is the finish line? Let's put it this way. So first of all, I want to have a working baseline, so that's the working Django templates and finish the sort of porting of Vue concepts onto Django. That's maybe three months away from completion. Then next step, you know, would be to to do minimal sort of integration with Vue, which would be supporting only the template section of Vue. Now, there
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense—there’s no clear "finish line" since this is an iterative process, but having a solid baseline with Django templates and Vue concepts is the immediate goal. If that’s about three months away, that’s pretty exciting!

You were about to explain the next step, which is integrating Vue’s template section. Could you continue? What would that look like in practice?

You said:
Yes, so the thing is that basically if we are to allow to write a view component or view files in non-JavaScript environments, then the template part is probably the easiest or most feasible, because as I mentioned at the beginning, the template section can be treated as text that can be pre-processed before it is actually rendered into HTML. And the view HTML is sort of declarative, right? So you write like v-if, v-for, but you don't really care how it is implemented as long as it is implemented somehow. And so that part can be implemented with relative ease in Python, for example, or on top of Django components. Next section, and also like in the template, there's like a limited amount of API or limited amount of features. The next would be tackling the CSS, because there is a similar case, right? Like the CSS is declarative. It's not the code itself. And so it doesn't matter if it gets processed in JavaScript or Python or other language. And again, the number of features in CSS is limited. Then comes the JavaScript section of the components. Like as I mentioned already, so I have already built sort of the backbone for writing view-like components on top of AlpineJS. So that's the bare minimum. And it has similar API that you specify the name, the props, the emits, the setup function, and so on. But then like that's the difficult part, and that's the part which is hard to predict or estimate right now, because there's a lot of features in that JavaScript section or API of view. And so that would probably take, I mean, I don't know, it could take a year.
ChatGPT said:
That breakdown makes a lot of sense. The template section is the easiest to implement since it’s just declarative text that can be pre-processed, and CSS follows a similar logic. But the JavaScript section is the real challenge, since Vue’s API has a ton of features that would need to be reimplemented outside of a JavaScript environment.

Given that the JavaScript part is the hardest and could take up to a year, do you see a scenario where projects could gradually adopt this system—maybe starting with templates and CSS in Django, but still relying on JavaScript for more complex interactivity? Or do you think full JavaScript-free Vue components are the ultimate goal?

You said:
Yes, so you were right with the first scenario. So the idea is that, and that's actually also one of the things which I'm missing in the Django or Python ecosystem, is that there is no simple way to easily add JavaScript to components. And that's not just the Django or Python ecosystem, but a larger, you could say, server-side rendered UI ecosystem, or the HTML over the wire pattern, which is oftentimes that instead of using JavaScript for changes on user behavior, you delegate to the server to fetch new bits of HTML, HTML fragments, and then you replace some bits in the HTML to react to the changes. And so this pattern is popular in non-JavaScript server-side web frameworks, but the limitation of this approach is that they usually try to avoid JavaScript at all costs. But the thing is that
ChatGPT said:
That’s a great point! Many server-rendered UI frameworks lean heavily on the "HTML over the wire" approach, where updates come from the server instead of being handled with JavaScript. But the downside is that these frameworks often avoid JavaScript entirely, making it harder to add interactivity when needed.

It sounds like your goal is to find a balance—keeping the simplicity of server-side rendering while allowing an easy way to introduce JavaScript when necessary. Were you about to explain how you’re tackling this problem?

You said:
What was the last thing that you caught?
ChatGPT said:
You were saying that many server-side UI frameworks follow the "HTML over the wire" pattern, where they avoid JavaScript entirely and instead update the UI by fetching new HTML fragments from the server. But you were about to explain why that limitation is a problem and how you’re addressing it.

You said:
Oh, man. Yeah, it's a shame that you've missed what I was just saying. But anyway, so...
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I get that—it’s frustrating when a thought gets lost. But I’m still with you! You were making a really interesting point about the limitations of avoiding JavaScript entirely. Feel free to pick up where you left off!

You said:
Wait, let me, maybe let's end here.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! This was a really insightful discussion. Thanks for sharing your work—I can tell you’ve put a lot of thought into bridging Vue with Django and Rust.
